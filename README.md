Summary 

App Name: MINdEXUS

Project Objective: 

Build a user-friendly web application that lets users to keep track of their media such as
books and movies. The app includes a list of media items you wish to see in the future and a list
of media items you have already seen in the past. Each media item is stored as an entry in their respective lists. Each list contains columns Title, Category, optional Keyword and optional Description. Users can add and remove a media entry from either list. This is the organization aspect of our MINdEXUS.

Our second aspect is discovery. Users have the option to tag their entries with keywords. An example of a keyword is "Action" for an item in the movie category. Other users can then search the app for a list of entries tagged with a keyword in a specific media category or across all categories. They have the option to sort the results by popularity (number of times the item has been added by different users for their MINdEXUS lists) or by rating (average rating).

The third aspect is social. Users can share their custom MINdEXUS lists to their friends. They can filter the list based on Category and/or Keyword. 


Target Audiences: consumers of media (such as movie goers, book readers, TV series watchers).

Key Principles: Striving for ease of use over efficiency of processing data in the backend. Keeping 				app design simple and strive for an intuitive UI.
