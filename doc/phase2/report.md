<b>Initial Planning</b>

Our definition for "Scrum master" is someone who manages the whole project by organizing all the team meetings and creating all the issues for the project. The Scrum master is the one to distribute tasks to each individual and to assign teammates to help others that are in need of help. In each meeting, the Scrum master is the one who records what each team member has to say. The Scrum master is basically our team leader.

The way that we estimated our task size was based upon a team evaluation. The Scrum master would bring up an issue and ask the team what the task size should be. Each team member would give their own opinion of how long it would take for the task to be completed and how confident they were in accomplishing that task. And together as a group we would vote whether or not it is a S, M, or L task size.

<b>Review & Retrospective</b>

=======
Our plan started off with our MVP. One of our group members (claudia) decided to draw the UI as a schematic which served as our baseline for features/development
as shown here: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/U34LG78HC#/screens/109071317
Afterwards, we all sat down together and had a sprint planning to create issues that needed to be done to implement the MVP and basic aspects of the project.
We created the baseline and prioritized certain issues that needed to be done as some issues were blocking other issues from being worked on. Once our plan had evolved from rough ideas,
we moved onto issues, after issues were set, we started to tackle them as a group before branching off to our respective tasks.

Some tasks that were incomplete were generally attributed to the short length of the sprint and commitments to other classes. Tasks such as, "Users can move entries from "to see list" to "seen it list"" relied on other tasks being completed first and was therefore blocked until a backend task was to be completed.

Some tasks that were split before before being completed as we were all learning how to work with the new technologies. We collaborated in a group meeting in order to knock off some issues. The tasks tackled were issues #12, #13, #14, #17, #18, #20, #27. These issues which were completed/worked upon represents the culmination of our group activity and collaboration in learning how the web app works. Everyone contributed to these issues.
