<b>Initial Planning</b>

Our definition for "Scrum master" is someone who manages the whole project by organizing all the team meetings and creating all the issues for the project. The Scrum master is the one to distribute tasks to each individual and to assign teammates to help others that are in need of help. In each meeting, the Scrum master is the one who records what each team member has to say. The Scrum master is basically our team leader.

The way that we estimated our task size was based upon a team evaluation. The Scrum master would bring up an issue and ask the team what the task size should be. Each team member would give their own opinion of how long it would take for the task to be completed and how confident they were in accomplishing that task. And together as a group we would vote whether or not it is a S, M, or L task size.

<b>Review & Retrospective</b>

1) Our plan started off with our MVP. One of our group members (claudia) decided to draw the UI as a 
schematic which served as our baseline for features/development
as shown here: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/U34LG78HC#/screens/109071317
Afterwards, we all sat down together and had a sprint planning to create issues that needed to be done 
to implement the MVP and basic aspects of the project.
We created the baseline and prioritized certain issues that needed to be done as some issues were 
blocking other issues from being worked on. Once our plan had evolved from rough ideas,
we moved onto issues, after issues were set, we started to tackle them as a group before branching off 
to our respective tasks.

a) Some tasks that were incomplete were generally attributed to the short length of the sprint and 
commitments to other classes. Tasks such as, "Users can move entries from 'to see list' to 'seen it list'" 
relied on other tasks being completed first and was therefore blocked until a backend task was to be 
completed.

b) Some tasks that were split before before being completed as we were all learning how to work with the 
new technologies. We collaborated in a group meeting in order to knock off some issues. 
The tasks tackled were issues #12, #13, #14, #17, #18, #20, #27. These issues which were completed/worked 
upon represents the culmination of our group activity and collaboration in learning how the web app works. 
Everyone contributed to these issues.

2)
a. 
		One of our major decisions in the early phase of the project is to use an existing 
	open-source tool that can scaffold our web application project by abstracting away 
	the management of different technologies and libraries required for the project. 
	This decision has worked really well so far since we were able to get the project up 
	to speed faster than anticipated. In addition, the Yeoman generator-angular-fullstack 
	(https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) 
	has provided us with a skeleton of a web app so we can focus on designing and implementing 
	our project by saving us time on setting and hooking up technologies such as angularJS 
	and MongoDB required by the project.
	
		Another decision that have gone well was that we have decided to finish the backend or 
	server-side of our web application first with minimum front-end elements for testing purposes. 
	By ensuring the backend is finished first, we can work on the front end knowing exactly what data 
	will be available for retrieval in the server and by extension the database. 
	
		There were a lot of problems during the beginning of phase 2 and they are described in part b. 
	After some time, we have decided to hold a mandatory meeting where every member of the team would 
	be present for making crucial technical as well as design decisions regarding the project. 
	This meeting occurred on Thursday, October 29 and it had gone very well. We have decided to change 
	the data model that I suggested in the beginning to something much simpler to work with. We also 
	resolved the client-side and server-side communication issue and correct data will now be displayed 
	to its corresponding user. During the meeting we have resolved 7 issues on Github outright and made 
	progress in all the remaining issues. 
	
 b. 
	Before we started working on the project, we have create a lot of issues on Github and assigned them 
	to each member of the team. When we were doing this, we were under the mindset that if we solve
	exactly what the descriptions of the issues said then we will be fine and we would not need much
	communication in person. Turns out that this is definitely not the case. A lot of us were confused on 
	the issues created several days ago due to not enough emphasis on the tasks that need to be done.
	Our lack of coordination in the beginning of the project also caused confusion on the order that the 
	issues should be tackled with. The unfamiliarity of the frameworks and libraries that we decided to
	use did not help with the situation at all.  All these factors were the causes of the low productivity 
	in the beginning of phase 2 as demonstrated by the burn-down chart. 

c. 	
		The problems described in part b can be mostly attributed to every member of the team had a busy 
	semester schedule throughout phase 2. As a result, we did not have sufficient time to communicate 
	with each other in between meetings which lead to lower productivity than expected. Ideally, we would 
	do a scrum meeting everyday and the scrum master would keep us on task constantly. In addition, this 
	is the first time doing agile development for many members of our group and thus this sense of 
	unfamiliarity had definitely slowed us down somewhat.
		Moving forward, I suggest we hold scrum and status meetings more frequently than they were in phase 2.
	In addition, we need to improve on planning out issues in a logical order so that we can minimize 
	confusion and miscommunications. To do that, I suggest we allocate more time for creating issues than
	in phase 2 and we need to get everyone on the same page during the planning process.
