<b>Initial Planning</b>

Our definition for "Scrum master" is someone who manages the whole project by organizing all the team meetings and creating all the issues for the project. The Scrum master is the one to distribute tasks to each individual and to assign teammates to help others that are in need of help. In each meeting, the Scrum master is the one who records what each team member has to say. The Scrum master is basically our team leader.

The way that we estimated our task size was based upon a team evaluation. The Scrum master would bring up an issue and ask the team what the task size should be. Each team member would give their own opinion of how long it would take for the task to be completed and how confident they were in accomplishing that task. And together as a group we would vote whether or not it is a S, M, or L task size.

<b>Sprint Backlog</b>

What our team planned to build for phase 2:<br>
For phase 2, we wanted to build a solid base for our web application and to start implementing some key features of the mvp. First off, we planned to build and set up much of the back-end including the database scaffold (issues #20,17,#14), API endpoints (#15) and connecting the tools we planned to use such as bower (a tools package manager for web development). For phase 2, we planned to set up the database enough such that it could store user emails and passwords as well as user media entries (#12, #13, #21, #27).

Our plan was to ensure the front-end of the app allowed users to register, log in and start viewing, adding and deleting entries in their account by the end of the phase 2 sprint (#24). This meant we needed the base HTML and CSS for the pages that would allow for this user interaction with our app. We also needed to make sure that the back-end and front-end components were integrated correctly. Beyond this, we planned ahead for building the other features of the mvp such as filtering and moving entries (#19).<br>

How the we planned to build it:<br>
Early in our planning, we decided to split the team into back end (Jason Phan, John, Steven) and front end (Claudia, Jason Tran). As we were dividing the responsibilities of who would work on what task, we made sure that each complicated task that involved both ends would have one person on one end assigned to the issue but also a team member on the other end to help. We decided we would focus on laying down the back-end groundwork first and then alternating between focusing on the back and front ends. We tried to plan a logical progression of which features we would work on, such as enabling adding entries before enabling editing or deleting entries.
<br>
Our planned general order of tasks were:<br>
1. use the yeoman angular-fullstack generator to scaffold our app and database<br>
2. learn from the generated scaffold and start building the app starting from the back end<br>
3. set up the “entry” element (back end base)<br>
4. populate a page on our web app with entry data from the database<br>
5. set up and test user instances and login system<br>
6. continue to add and refine features of the mvp by starting with back end then working on front end<br>

Our specific planned division of responsibilities in order:
- #12 Claudia & Steven
- #20 Phan & Tran
- #21 Steven
- #14 Phan
- #18 Tran & Claudia
- #15 Steven and John and Phan
- #19 Claudia
- #13 John
- #26 all backend
- #16 Phan & John
- #17 Steven & Claudia
- #27 Tran & John
- #28 Tran & Phan
- #23 Claudia & Steven
- #22 Phan & Claudia

<b>Update Meetings</b>

Meeting #1:  
Date and Time: October 20 at 9:10 PM  
Location: Skype  
Attendance: Entire group  

Description:  
We had an online conference call to discuss the responsibilities of each member in our group, and we wanted to decide on which web development frameworks to use in the process of building our web application. It was decided amongst the group that there should be 2 teams to handle the front-end and back-end development. The team responsible for back-end is Jason Phan, John, and Steven; front-end is Claudia and Jason Tran. The discussion on available frameworks along with online resources that would help us develop our application lead the group to let each team decide on which resources and frameworks they felt comfortable with to accomplish their part. The group will meet again in the upcoming days to decide on which frameworks they want to work with. 

Meeting #2:  
Date and Time: October 23 at 10PM  
Location: Skype  
Attendance: Entire group  

Description:  
The purpose of this group meeting was to decide on what tasks had to be completed in order to have our product working, and to assign specific tasks to members in the group. Before tasks were assigned to individuals, we ranked each task’s difficulty to prioritize which tasks should be completed first, and to ensure that a task had a reasonable amount of individuals working on it. We split the tasks and marked them as “issues” on Github. Here is a link to the issues:
https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team4-L0101/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue
We had also finalized which tools and frameworks we would use for front-end and back-end development.

Meeting #3:  
Date and Time: October 29 at 10PM  
Location: Skype  
Attendance: Entire group  

Description:  
The purpose of this meeting was to collaborate to eliminate issues that required both front-end and back-end integration. Since there were many new technologies to be learned, this was a great way for group members with experience to help and clarify the use of these tools and help each other with difficult tasks. The conference call was extremely effective as we closed 7 issues; #12, #13, #14, #17, #18, #20, and #27 to be specific. 

Meeting #4:  
Date and Time: November 1 at 11PM  
Location: Skype  
Attendance: Entire group  

Description:  
In our final meeting before phase 2’s due date, we discussed the current state of our project. In terms of the MVP and stability of our project, everything is going as expected. The functionality we wanted for this phase is complete, and there are currently a few adjustments being made to the user interface. There was live testing of our web application during the call to ensure that it was functioning as expected before we submitted our project code. Afterwards, our group closed many issues(tasks) that had been completed and made sure that there were no issues with the artifacts that we will be submitting for this phase.

<b>Burndown Chart</b> 

For every issue, we decided that all S, M, and L tasks are converted into 1, 2, 3 story points respectively. For each issue, 2 members (one front-end and back-end person) were assigned to the task.

<b>Review & Retrospective</b>

1) Our plan started off with our MVP. One of our group members (claudia) decided to draw the UI as a 
schematic which served as our baseline for features/development
as shown here: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/U34LG78HC#/screens/109071317
Afterwards, we all sat down together and had a sprint planning to create issues that needed to be done 
to implement the MVP and basic aspects of the project.
We created the baseline and prioritized certain issues that needed to be done as some issues were 
blocking other issues from being worked on. Once our plan had evolved from rough ideas,
we moved onto issues, after issues were set, we started to tackle them as a group before branching off 
to our respective tasks.

a) Some tasks that were incomplete were generally attributed to the short length of the sprint and 
commitments to other classes. Tasks such as, "Users can move entries from 'to see list' to 'seen it list'" 
relied on other tasks being completed first and was therefore blocked until a backend task was to be 
completed.

b) Some tasks that were split before before being completed as we were all learning how to work with the 
new technologies. We collaborated in a group meeting in order to knock off some issues. 
The tasks tackled were issues #12, #13, #14, #17, #18, #20, #27. These issues which were completed/worked 
upon represents the culmination of our group activity and collaboration in learning how the web app works. 
Everyone contributed to these issues.

2)
a. 
    One of our major decisions in the early phase of the project is to use an existing open-source tool that can scaffold our web application project by abstracting away the management of different technologies and libraries required for the project. This decision has worked really well so far since we were able to get the project up to speed faster than anticipated. In addition, the Yeoman generator-angular-fullstack (https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) has provided us with a skeleton of a web app so we can focus on designing and implementing our project by saving us time on setting and hooking up technologies such as angularJS and MongoDB required by the project.
	
Another decision that have gone well was that we have decided to finish the backend or server-side of our web application first with minimum front-end elements for testing purposes. By ensuring the backend is finished first, we can work on the front end knowing exactly what data will be available for retrieval in the server and by extension the database.

There were a lot of problems during the beginning of phase 2 and they are described in part b. After some time, we have decided to hold a mandatory meeting where every member of the team would be present for making crucial technical as well as design decisions regarding the project. This meeting occurred on Thursday, October 29 and it had gone very well. We have decided to change the data model that I suggested in the beginning to something much simpler to work with. We also resolved the client-side and server-side communication issue and correct data will now be displayed to its corresponding user. During the meeting we have resolved 7 issues on Github outright and made progress in all the remaining issues.
	
 b. 
	Before we started working on the project, we have create a lot of issues on Github and assigned them 
	to each member of the team. When we were doing this, we were under the mindset that if we solve
	exactly what the descriptions of the issues said then we will be fine and we would not need much
	communication in person. Turns out that this is definitely not the case. A lot of us were confused on 
	the issues created several days ago due to not enough emphasis on the tasks that need to be done.
	Our lack of coordination in the beginning of the project also caused confusion on the order that the 
	issues should be tackled with. The unfamiliarity of the frameworks and libraries that we decided to
	use did not help with the situation at all.  All these factors were the causes of the low productivity 
	in the beginning of phase 2 as demonstrated by the burn-down chart. 
	
c.	The problems described in part b can be mostly attributed to every member of the team had a busy semester 		schedule throughout phase 2. As a result, we did not have sufficient time to communicate with each other 		in between meetings which lead to lower productivity than expected. Ideally, we would do a scrum 		meeting everyday and the scrum master would keep us on task constantly. In addition, this is the first time 	doing agile development for many members of our group and thus this sense of unfamiliarity had definitely slowed 	us down somewhat. Moving forward, I suggest we hold scrum and status meetings more frequently than they were 		in phase 2. In addition, we need to improve on planning out issues in a logical order so that we can 			minimize confusion and miscommunications. To do that, I suggest we allocate more time for creating 		issues than in phase 2 and we need to get everyone on the same page during the planning process.
