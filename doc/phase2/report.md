<b>Initial Planning</b>

Our definition for "Scrum master" is someone who manages the whole project by organizing all the team meetings and creating all the issues for the project. The Scrum master is the one to distribute tasks to each individual and to assign teammates to help others that are in need of help. In each meeting, the Scrum master is the one who records what each team member has to say. The Scrum master is basically our team leader.

The way that we estimated our task size was based upon a team evaluation. The Scrum master would bring up an issue and ask the team what the task size should be. Each team member would give their own opinion, and together as a group we would vote whether or not it is a S, M, or L task size.
