Planning

Our team goals were to complete outstanding work from Phase 2 and make significant progress towards the finished product while keeping the envision of our finished product as well. 
Moreover, our plan involved adding more user customizability by allowing users to sort their media entries, adding custom lists which allows users to add media entries to custom lists for sharing amongst other users.The initial plan included user customizability and accessibility by implementing sort functionality, custom list, custom queries to the server, searching for other user's custom lists and other issues. 
Initially we intended touch up the UI while adding functionality but we ended up finishing functionality before correcting the UI or keeping the UI in mind.

On some occassions we ran into time constraints which involved re-planning on what needed to be done first and foremost. 
We ended up agreeing that we needed to add new features and focus on the UI last. 
We managed to complete sort functionality, custom list, custom queries to the server, searching for other user's custom lists and other issues. 

Review and Retrospective:

	Our plan was to meet up on certain days and grind out a bunch of work at a time in order to fit our schedule. 
	Our plan and process actually worked as we were able to communicate in long skype sessions which contributed to the significant process towards the end product. We felt that method was able to accomodate everyone's school schedule

	Unfortunately some goals were not met. Whether it be a problem of time management or lack of communication there was one outstanding issue that was to be completed in Phase 2 which was not completed (Issue #23) which involved filtering their own list by categories.

	In terms of improvement, we have decided that we should communicate often and delegate tasks responsibly. We also agreed that individually we all need to seek help if there may be any impediments that may be blocking progress. Lastly, we decided to also keep the UI in mind through all stages of the phase.
