<b>Tools that we used:</b> 

  We used MongoDB for the database. MongoDB is a document-based database that provides an inutitive way store data in a javascript object-oriented manner. We used Mongoose as a object modeling tool which provides a boilder plate for database validation and casting data via JSON. WE chose NodeJS to be our backend framework along with ExpressJS to simplify routing configurations. Lastly we used AngularJS to be our front-end framework which allows us to handle two-way data-binding easily. We used the Yeoman scaffold to put and configure all of the aforementioned frameworks together and enabled to us to create angularJS controllers via the terminal. A lot of the JavaScript libraries that were used in the project are managed by NPM (node package manager) and Bower which provided us the convenience of being able to easily download libraries we need by a console command. We used the Grunt tool to test and deploy our application.
  
  
  We chose the MEAN stack because it provides us the ability of easily serialize data across all of our application layers via JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The data object we used constantly throughout development is the "entry" object that contains a list of fields such as title, date created, category and so on. It is represented very nicely using the JSON format and as a result we are able to store and fetch data easily with little overhead due to the fact we used JavaScript for both the client side and the server side. In addition, using bootstrap and the angularJS framework has made front-end tasks such as styling and displaying repeated elements easier. 

<b>Meeting Minutes</b> <br>
Meeting #1 <br>
Date: Monday November 9: <br>
Time: 8:10PM <br>
<br>
The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the current state, and the future of the project. We discussed the goals we wanted to achieve before the phase 3 — that meant to look at the remaining issues and prioritized them based on importance to the M.V.P and mostly to the time constraints from each member’s school schedule. Some back-end functionality was added.<br>
<br>
Meeting #2<br>
Date: Monday November 16:<br>
Time: 9:00PM<br>
<br>
Tonight’s meeting was to discuss the progress made since the last meeting. Aside from the back-end functionality added previously, very little progress was made due to each member’s course load. We agreed to meet later this week to try to finish up the remaining issues.<br>
<br>
Meeting #3<br>
Date: Thursday November 19:<br>
Time: 9:00PM<br>
<br>
During this conference call, we collaborated to finish up a couple of key features that were essential to the M.V.P.: custom lists and full-featured search. We found that these features were challenging to implement as there was a lot of back-end code to develop, and properly accessing the database for certain functions could be tricky. Overall, the call was productive as significant progress was made towards the search function, and database access.<br>
<br>
Meeting #4<br>
Date: Sunday November 22:<br>
Time: 10PM<br>
<br>
In our final meeting before the deadline, we collaborated again to complete the search function, and to make enhancements to the user interface. The custom lists functionality is nearly complete. With the exception to the custom lists, we have ensured that our application is stable and good to go for our next demo with the TA.<br>
<br>
<b>Burndown Chart:</b> <br>
We used the same method in Phase 2 in converting task sizes to story points where each member gives their opinion on what the task size should be. Large, Medium and Small tasks are 3, 2, 1 story points respectively. <br>
